		This placeholder site will one day contain a proper portfolio for my work and hobbies. The current site is an experiment looking
		into forrestry.io and Jekyll as a static web-site stack we have considered for work-related projects.

      Lately I've been looking into new technologies to replace Angular 1.x for work related projects. I've also been looking into how I want
      to make my own website, now that I've got a free domain name. Github is working out great as a hosting platform for testing out 
      the different frameworks and libraries for static websites. This site is created using forestry.io CMS and Jekyll.</p><p>Other projects such as my <a href="http://www.devduck.me/StaticWebsiteExperiments/">dabbeling with Aurelia</a> will be hosted here as well.<br></p></div>
