    <h2 id="me">Me</h2>

<p>My name is Cato, this is my blog and home page. The site is mostly a place for me to write down rants, things I learn, observations and other miscellaneous debris. </p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>

<p>After a (failed)<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"> attempt at becoming a bonafide rockstar by drumming and strumming with friends in Trondheim and Bergen, I moved to Oslo where I worked in a couple of bars for some years. I realized I needed to sleep more and started my bachelors in Computer Science…</span></p>

<p>I’ve been lucky to have worked at Center for Shared Discussion Making and Collaborative Care Research during my studies, and now I’m a full time employee. The focus has been on web-technologies such as .net, angular, less/sass, but we have also made applications using frameworks such as apache flex, unity3d and ionic. <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Being a small team (3-5) we all get to work on most aspects of development and process management.</span></p>

<h2 id="span-styleletter-spacing-001emmusicspan"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Music</span></h2>

<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.18px;">As well as spending a lot of time in front of the computer programming and playing, I also try to make time for music. I recently bought a Roland td-9 in order to maintain and develop my drumming. I plan on putting up some tracks here when I get around to recording and completing something.</span></p>
