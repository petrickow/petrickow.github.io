## Me

This site is mostly a place for me (Cato) to write down rants, things I learn, observations and other miscellaneous debris.

## Programming

After a (failed) attempt at becoming a bonafide rockstar by drumming and strumming with friends in Trondheim and Bergen, I moved to Oslo where I worked in a couple of bars for some years. I realized I needed to sleep more and started my bachelors in Computer Science...

I was lucky to work while studying at Center for Shared Discussion Making and Collaborative Care Research. The focus there was web-technologies such as .net, angular, less/sass, but we have also made applications using frameworks such as apache flex, unity3d and ionic. Being a small team (3-5) we all get to work on most aspects of development and process management. I now work as an consultant at Computas on different projcets.

## Music

As well as spending a lot of time in front of the computer programming and playing, I also try to make time for music. I recently bought a Roland td-9 in order to maintain and develop my drumming. I plan on putting up some tracks here when I get around to recording and completing something.
