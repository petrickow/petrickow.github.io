## Me

My name is Cato, this is my blog and home page. The site is mostly a place for me to write down rants, things I learn, observations and other miscellaneous debris. 

## Programming

After a (failed)<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"> attempt at becoming a bonafide rockstar by drumming and strumming with friends in Trondheim and Bergen, I moved to Oslo where I worked in a couple of bars for some years. I realized I needed to sleep more and started my bachelors in Computer Science...</span>

I've been lucky to have worked at Center for Shared Discussion Making and Collaborative Care Research during my studies, and now I'm a full time employee. The focus has been on web-technologies such as .net, angular, less/sass, but we have also made applications using frameworks such as apache flex, unity3d and ionic. <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Being a small team (3-5) we all get to work on most aspects of development and process management.</span>

## <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Music</span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.18px;">As well as spending a lot of time in front of the computer programming and playing, I also try to make time for music. I recently bought a Roland td-9 in order to maintain and develop my drumming. I plan on putting up some tracks here when I get around to recording and completing something.</span>
