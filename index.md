<p>Thanks for dropping by this work in progress site, made using
  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>,
  <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> and
  <a href="https://forestry.io">forestry.io</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My <a href="/blog">blog</a> will mostly contain notes and scribbles mostly for my own musing. The site as a whole will function as a landing page for my professional and hobby portfolio for both programming and music.
